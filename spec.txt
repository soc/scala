The return type of an unapply:

 - Must have isEmpty
 - May have get - used if so
 - May have _1, _2, _3; used if no "get"

 If the match site has fixed/sequence patterns:

  0/0   - boolean (and/or empty sequence?)
  1/0   - any fixed arity (SI-6675), no sequence
  n/0   - same fixed arity, optional sequence
  0/1   - sequence
  1/1   - any fixed arity, mandatory sequence
  n/1   - same fixed arity, mandatory sequence
